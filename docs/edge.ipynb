Given that the semi-infinite system consists of 2D principle layers which can only interact with one layer above or below it, the Hamiltonian of the semi-infite system is therefore a tridigonal matrix. Its soluton can be found in J. Phys. F: Met. Phys. 14 (1984) 1205-1215. Green's function for the surface layer becomes  \n",

One thing to note is that typically there are more than one orbital per principle layer which means that $G_{00}$ is a matrix, which is why we used trace of $G_{00}$ when calculating the spectral function of topmost layer.\n",
